                    Hello! <br />
                    <br />
                    You see this message because Org Check is taking more than 30 seconds to load.<br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <b>Potential reason #1:</b> This may be due to a new version that has been pushed to your org or maybe this is 
                      the first time you run Org Check.<br />                    
                    <br />
                    <b><u>Solution:</u> In that case, just wait a little longer, as the application will come shortly.</b><br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <b>Potential reason #2:</b> There might be another explanation that is preventing Org Check to load successfuly.<br />
                    Under the section <code>Session</code> in the setup menu of this org, there must be 
                       two specific settings <b>both enabled at the same time</b> that are causing this 
                       issue.<br />
                    These settings are :<br />
                    1. Option <b><code>Enable Content Delivery Network (CDN) for Lightning Component framework</code></b><br />
                    2. Option <b><code>Cross-Origin Embedder Policy (COEP)</code></b><br />
                    <br />
                    <b><u>Solution:</u> This issue is corrected if you disable either one of the two options previously mentioned in the <a href="/lightning/setup/SecuritySession/home" target="_blank">setup menu</a>.</b><br />
